# Social-Network-API-Cypress

In this project, I used a pre-existing  API for a social network web application project and perform some  End to End automation Tests using Cypress.io. The Tests done in this project were HTTP Requests and Query Parameters Tests. 1The API used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

# A) Getting Started on the Testing

1. To get started with running the project, use nmp run watch on your Terminal

2. Open a second Terminal and run npx cypress open to open cypress dashboard and run the tests

# B) Expected Test Results:

1. The HTTP Tests should all pass

2. The Query Params Tests should all Pass

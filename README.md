# Social-Network-API

The challenge in this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It was required that we use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site.and Mongoose Links to an external site.packages, one may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

# A) The user requirements for this project were:

AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

# B) The Acceptance Criteria for the project was:

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts


THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create

update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
